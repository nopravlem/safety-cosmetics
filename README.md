## Product Info
### Mission
The cosmetic industry is very unregulated, which means there can be almost anything in your products. The purpose of this application is to spread knowledge not only in the sources and effects of the ingridents used, but the ethics behind testing and manufacturing each product. We are definitely headed towards a world where customers prefer products that are clean and natural, so by making this information accessible to everyone, people can make more educated decisions.

It should be clear that all your cosmetics are in fact safe (otherwise, the FDA would not approve it). There is no need to completely dispose of everything in your supply. Yes, some products may not be the best for your skin, but everything is safe. This is primarily to make shopping for cosmetics easier with all information readily available.

Here's a blog of the journey through this project.
